# typing-speed-app
A Typing Speed Application

Requirements
============
- As a users, I can go the application to test my typing speed.
- As a user, when I click on a button, I am given a paragraph which I am supposed to type. Once I submit, the application calculates my typing speed. 
- As a user, I can see a leaderboard.

**Extra Credit**
- Use `firebase` to persist data (as a datastore)
